# Synopsis

Hi! I'm **Arlirad** a/k/a **Tymoteusz**. I do the coding kind of thing in mostly in **C#**, occasionally dabbling with **TS** in *Angular* and formerly in **C++**.

I like to tinker around and build projects even for the sole purpose of experimenting with new approaches.

Feel free to have a look around my repositories!
